# Hi, how-are-you?

This project is a small script which, when paired with crontab, asks you each day to rank how you're feeling and logs it.  If you're not on your computer at the time that it prompts, it skips that day.

Running the `how-are-you.py` script generates a file called `feelings.txt` which is used to store your feelings entries.  For now, I'm not going to upload my `feelings.txt`, for obvious reasons.
